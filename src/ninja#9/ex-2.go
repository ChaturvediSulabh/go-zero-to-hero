// This exercise will reinforce our understanding of method sets:
// create a type person struct
// attach a method speak to type person using a pointer receiver
// *person
// create a type human interface
// to implicitly implement the interface, a human must have the speak method
// create func â€œsay Something
// have it take in a human as a parameter
// have it call the speak method
// show the following in your code
// you CAN pass a value of type *person into saySomething
// you CANNOT pass a value of type person into saySomething
// here is a hint if you need some help
package main

import "fmt"

type person struct {
	First string
	Last  string
}

func (p *person) speak() {
	fmt.Printf("%s %s can speak", *&p.First, *&p.Last)
}

type human interface {
	speak()

func saySomething(h human) {
	h.speak()
